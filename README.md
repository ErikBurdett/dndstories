- perhaps multiple tables interacting - Character Table, Spellbook Table, Stories Table, User/Profile Table?

DnD Stories Podcast: A simple Podcast simply about DnD Stories - stories of single battles, entire campaigns, and even just shooting the shit about cool DnD Stuff & lore. 

- divided up into simple sections that can be split up into easily soundbittable snippets, similar to the JRE clips youtube channel.
